# advantage_air_myair3
 Home Assistant - Custom Component for Advantage Air MyAir3 system

This is rough.

An implementation of Advantage Air's MyAir3 system into Home Assistant.
This uses local API to query the unit directly. 
Only matches my unit whilst I work on this to get it working.

IP is hard coded
Number of units is hard coded
Not a lot works


## To-Do
v 0.0.1
Get MVP
** All zones are viewable and their status (on/off)
** Show power status (on/off)

v 0.0.2
Add in functionality to self-locate the system IP and configure

### Future
Power switch
Zone switches
Zone %'age openness sliding scale
Timer
Change fan settings
